<h2>Other Controls</h2>
<p>On the very bottom of the screen, next to the statusbar are a couple more fields that give you information during the game:<br />
'Out' tells you how many lemmings&trade; are currently walking about the level<br />
'Home' tells you how many lemmings&trade; have safely made it to the exit<br />
'Time' tells you how many time you still have left in the game</p>
<p>Furthermore the following keys can be used to control sound and animations during play:<br /><br />
1 - turns music and sound off during the level<br />
2 - turns music and sound on during the level<br />
3 - turns animations off during the level<br />
4 - turns animations on during the level<br />
<br />Don't use you numpad for these keys; that won't work.<br />Note that if you want to have these options applied to all levels, you need to set the options in the main menu.</p>
<p>Last but not least you can use the ESC key to immediately quit a level and return to the main menu.</p>
