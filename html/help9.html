<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Unlike the original game DHTML lemmings&trade; requires a lot of resources (around 10 - 20MB of memory) and a fast
processor to run smoothly. A 500MHz processor will do, but above 1GHz it becomes much more enjoyable. You will need
at least a 2GHz processor for the fast forward mode to work correctely (AMD's are faster than P4's :P )</p>
<p>Javascript isn't a fast programming language because it needs to be interpreted at execution time. However it does
have the advantage that most browsers are javascript enabled, so you won't need anything more than a modern browser.</p>
<p>DHTML Lemmings&trade; has been written to work in IE5.5 and above and in recent Mozilla versions (around 1.3 and higher). Other
browsers (such as Opera) may or may not be able to run DHTML Lemmings&trade;</p>
<p>Note that this project is a work in progress, by no means is this version complete and free of bugs; feel free to report anything
unusual to me.</p>
<p>You can also run lemmings&trade; offline, the complete sourcecode (except for elements that may be copyrighted) can be found <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~crisp/lemmings/lemmings.zip" target="_blank" onfocus="this.blur()">here</a>
and I also have a PHP script to generate the JS levelcode with examples which can be found <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~crisp/lemmings/makelevel.zip" target="_blank" onfocus="this.blur()">here</a>.<br />
