<h2>Starting a game</h2>
<p>Lemmings&trade; is organised into four increasingly difficult game categories: FUN,
TRICKY, TAXING and MAYHEM. The FUN category consists of 30 levels and is
designed to familiarise you with the game concept and how to work with 
Lemmings&trade; skill attributes. You don't have to start with this category: You
can go directly to any of the higher skill categories but we suggest that you
begin with at least a few of the levels in the FUN category to get the feel
of the game before proceeding to the more difficult categories.</p>
<p>TRICKY, TAXING and MAYHEM increase in difficulty with the MAYHEM level being the most 
difficult. Each of the game categories has 30 levels*</p>
<p>To start a game of lemmings&trade;, just select the desired difficulty from the
<a href="menu.html" target="_self">main menu</a>. You will be presented a selection
box with the levels available for that difficulty. When you haven't played a level yet
the first level will be highlighted, and the code for that level will be already filled
in. Just press 'Play!' to let the action begin!</p>
<p>* Note that because this is just work in progress not all levels and difficulties are available yet.</p>
