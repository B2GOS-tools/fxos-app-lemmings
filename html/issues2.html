<div id="content"><h1>Known Issues</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Why doesn't this game work in Konqueror/Safari? They are modern browsers too!<br />True, but apparently they are still lacking some basic ECMA or CSS2 support; I have tested it in Konqueror, but there where some bugs in that browser I couldn't quite get around.</li>
  <li>How about copyright? Do you have permission to publish this?<br />Simply: no I don't (yet). See the <a href="disclaimer.html" target="_self" onfocus="this.blur()">disclaimer</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Some lemming animations are buggy!<br />Yep, some of them may not be perfect yet; I made them such that all levels should be playable, but you might see them do some crazy stuff once in a while.</li>
  <li>I don't hear any music or sounds!<br />Crossbrowser sound-support is still a true nightmare with all the plugins and stuff. Sound should work in windows IE via the Media Player 6.4 as well as in Mozilla in windows when you have the <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/plugin.htm" target="_blank" onfocus="this.blur()">ActiveX plugin</a>. Also the quicktime plugin in Mozilla should give you sound, or any other plugin that can recognize the audio/midi or audio/wav mimetype.</li>
  <li>Can I put this game on my site?<br />Yes and No, you can distribute and publish this game, but in case you have a full version only without the graphics and the music since those items are copyrighted by others. The <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~crisp/lemmings/lemmings.zip" target="_blank" onfocus="this.blur()">download</a> comes without these items, and you can always add your own graphics and music.</li>
  <li>Can I make my own levels?<br />Yes, but it takes some figuring out how to setup the levelfiles. If you have nice levels you are willing to share, mail them to me and I will give you directions. In return you should let me use your levels in any future versions (mentioning your name as the creator).</li>
