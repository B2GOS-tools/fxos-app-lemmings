<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>Lemmings&trade; is an intriguing game in which you help hordes of
otherwise-mindless creatures - knows as walkers - escape hostile 
environments.</p>
<p>Lemmings&trade; drop through a trapdoor onto each screen and, as they're creatures
of very little brain, they need all the help they can get to survive the 
dangers that lie within.</p>
<p>To assist these cuddly, yet suicidally stupid creatures you use your mouse 
(similar to a lemming but it has buttons) to select a skill from the panel
of icons at the base of the screen, to perform that skill. You have a strict
time limit in which to get a required percentage of the little perishers 
through each level.</p>
<p>A quick brain, the ability to plan ahead and lifetime's dedication to save a
Lemming Campaign are required to get the right Lemming to perform the right
action at the right time. A forgotten Blocker or a misplaced bridge could 
spell disaster for every lemming on screen.</p>
