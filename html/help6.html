<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Lemmings&trade; is normally played with the mouse. You can select a skill from one of the icons at the bottom
of the screen by clicking on it (the button becomes animated) and than pointing and clicking on a lemming.
You can see which lemming will be selected by the target area surrounding the lemming when you hover over it
with your mouse. The statusbar on the bottom-left will show you the current skill of the selected lemming and
it's number (lemmings&trade; don't have names).<br />If you press the right or left arrow on your keyboard, you will only target lemmings&trade; that go right or left at that moment.</p>
<p>Not all skills are available in every level; the number in the icon will tell you how many of each skill
you can use. If it doesn't show a number than that skill is unavailable in that particular level.</p>
<p>All icons will show you it's purpose when you hover over it.</p>
<p>Furthermore notice the scrollbar; many levels extend beyond the visible part of the screen.
If you cannot find the exit, try scrolling left or right.</p>
